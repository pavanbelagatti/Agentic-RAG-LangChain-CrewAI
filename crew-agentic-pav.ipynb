In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer\\n\\nIn terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6\\n\\nfactor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model. As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences. 5 Training This section describes the training regime for our models. 5.1 Training Data and Batching We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source- target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens.

large language models in several ways:\n\n* It allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence that are relevant to the task at hand, rather than treating the entire sequence as a single entity.\n* It enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and relationships between different parts of the input sequence.\n* It helps the model to attend to the most important information in the input sequence, which can improve the model's ability to generate coherent and relevant text.\n* It allows the model to capture complex contextual relationships between different parts of the input sequence, which can improve the model's ability to understand and generate text.\n\nThese benefits can lead to improved performance and accuracy of large language models, particularly in tasks that require understanding and generating long sequences of text, such as language translation, text summarization, and language generation.\u001b[0m\n\n\u001b[1m> Finished
